Color-bands indicate the onset and duration of each condition in the task (green: tongue, purple: left-hand finger-tapping, blue: right-hand finger-tapping, red: left-foot toes, orange: right-foot toes). Rows 2-6: time-series of a representative voxel for each task with the PFM-estimated innovation (blue), PFM-estimated activity-inducing (green), and activity-related (i.e., fitted, orange) signals, with their corresponding GLM, PFM, and TA maps on the right. The maps shown on the right are sampled at the time-point labeled with the red arrows and display the innovation signals at that moment across the whole brain.","key":"rI4Sy83QIh"}],"key":"V0LgXQs4M6"}],"key":"jlQux5zZMt"}],"align":"center","label":"fig:task_mad","identifier":"fig:task_mad","enumerator":"9","html_id":"fig-task-mad","key":"H2oMxpi3fd"},{"type":"container","position":{"start":{"offset":6378,"line":134,"column":1},"end":{"offset":7010,"line":145,"column":14}},"kind":"figure","children":[{"type":"image","url":"/supp_caps_mad-9d5935211c30c1bfa58a9ae929738f83.pdf","position":{"start":{"offset":6425,"line":136,"column":9},"end":{"offset":6441,"line":136,"column":25}},"alt":"Activity-inducing CAPs (left) and innovation CAPs (right) obtained with the PFM-estimated activity-inducing and innovation signals respectively, using a MAD-based selection of \\lambda.
