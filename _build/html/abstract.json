Expanding further, the third\nobjective of this thesis is to extend the multivariate PFM formulation to a\nmulti-subject framework, facilitating the estimation of shared and\nindividualized neuronal-related activity across subjects. This approach proved\nparticularly suitable for naturalistic fMRI experiments. Lastly, the fourth and\nlast goal of this work is to introduce an additional regularization term, the\nnuclear norm, into the multivariate PFM formulation. This term was employed to\nestimate global fluctuations during the deconvolution process and mitigate their\nimpact on the estimation of neuronal-related activity, thereby reducing bias.","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"FlgOwsgRaW"}],"key":"yjaFfM4WBd"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":33,"column":1},"end":{"line":50,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The techniques presented in this thesis were thoroughly evaluated using\nsimulations and experimental fMRI datasets. Comparisons were made with\nestablished fMRI analysis methods, including the single-trial\ngeneral linear model, previous PFM algorithms, and other\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Notably, the developed methods demonstrated the\nability to accurately detect single trial BOLD responses in resting-state and\nnaturalistic fMRI data, without relying on prior event information.\nAdditionally, the potential application of multi-subject PFM in\nidentifying both shared and individualized neuronal-related activity in more\necological datasets was explored, yielding promising results. Moreover, the\nutilization of low-rank and sparse PFM facilitated the extraction of\nglobal fluctuations, such as the global signal, physiological fluctuations, and\nmotion artifacts, thereby reducing their influence on the analysis. In summary,\nthis work demonstrates that PFM techniques can be used to reliably\nretrieve the neuronal-related activity from fMRI data without any prior\ninformation about the experimental paradigm, and that there now exists a\nformulation of PFM that is suitable for potentially any experimental\nsetting and research question.","position":{"start":{"line":33,"column":1},"end":{"line":33,"column":1}},"key":"CXqsaWUeoS"}],"key":"LGRIwaXNlg"}],"key":"AtJibxRCFj"}],"key":"y1jx20McLy"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"prev":{"title":"Unraveling Hidden Patterns of Brain Activity: A Journey Through Hemodynamic Deconvolution in Functional MRI","url":"/","group":"Unraveling Hidden Patterns of Brain Activity: A Journey Through Hemodynamic Deconvolution in Functional MRI"},"next":{"title":"Acronyms","url":"/acronyms","group":"Unraveling Hidden Patterns of Brain Activity: A Journey Through Hemodynamic Deconvolution in Functional MRI"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3001"}
