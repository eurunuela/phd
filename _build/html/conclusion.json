In\nthis case, instead of concatenating voxels or ROIs to form a time by space matrix, the same voxel\nor ROI from different subjects was used to create a time by subject matrix. The underlying\nassumption is that the estimation of neuronal-related activity should not be significantly affected\nby anatomical and functional differences between subjects once their data has been aligned to a\nshared space or template. This assumption holds true when analyzing data at the ROI level, where\ndifferences are smoothed out during averaging and spatial resolution is reduced. However, when\nworking with voxels, this assumption no longer holds, and differences across subjects are expected.\nDue to the immense computational cost and memory requirements of simultaneously deconvolving 43\nsubjects at the voxel level, the analysis in this chapter was performed at the ROI level, where the\nassumption remained valid. The results demonstrated the capability of the multi-subject PFM (msPFM)\nalgorithm to detect shared and individualized neuronal-related activity across subjects without\nprior knowledge. Furthermore, the technique successfully linked moment-to-moment brain activity to\nits underlying causes. Encouragingly, the group synchrony metric showed significant correlations\nwith changes in luminance, audio, speech, the presence of hands, and the presence of faces.\nImportantly, msPFM was able to adapt to different movies. For example, in the movie “Iteration,”\nwhere a single character’s face was frequently shown, the group synchrony metric correlated with\nthe presence of faces in left middle temporal gyrus, which is associated with face familiarity and\ngaze. In contrast, in the movie “Sherlock,” where multiple characters appeared and facial\nidentification was more challenging, the group synchrony metric correlated with changes in the\npresence of faces in the fusiform face areas. These findings indicate that participants may have\nadapted to certain characteristics of the stimuli, such as luminance and the presence of faces, and\nthat the msPFM estimates were able to capture this adaptation. Although these results are\npromising, many questions still remain unanswered. For instance, utilizing msPFM could help us\nunderstand how the human brain comprehends complex multiplexed signals and identify the specific\nstimulus features that elicit responses. Furthermore, msPFM has the potential to elucidate the\nconnection between individual differences in these responses and subsequent memory formation or\nappraisal of the stimulus.","position":{"start":{"line":52,"column":1},"end":{"line":52,"column":1}},"key":"X7n2MyRJMc"}],"key":"FkEv4NyKUS"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":82,"column":1},"end":{"line":95,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In ","position":{"start":{"line":82,"column":1},"end":{"line":82,"column":1}},"key":"HI3Mt5uV9E"},{"type":"link","kind":"ref","identifier":"cha-low-rank","label":"cha-low-rank","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chapter 6","key":"Oll8PVYKFm"}],"url":"/low-rank","internal":true,"dataUrl":"/low-rank.json","key":"RMXdeT0RTB"},{"type":"text","value":", the nuclear norm was employed as an additional regularization\nterm in the multivariate PFM formulation.
